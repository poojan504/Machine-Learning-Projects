%% mackeyglass_rk4
% This function computes the numerical solution of the Mackey-Glass
% delayed differential equation using the 4-th order Runge-Kutta method


%%
% *Matlab code:*
function x_t_plus_deltat = mackeyglass_rk4(x_t, x_t_minus_tau, deltat, a, b)
    k1 = deltat*mackeyglass_eq(x_t,          x_t_minus_tau, a, b); % 1st coefficient
    k2 = deltat*mackeyglass_eq(x_t+0.5*k1,   x_t_minus_tau, a, b); % 2nd coefficient
    k3 = deltat*mackeyglass_eq(x_t+0.5*k2,   x_t_minus_tau, a, b); % 3rd coefficient
    k4 = deltat*mackeyglass_eq(x_t+k3,       x_t_minus_tau, a, b); % 4th coefficient
    x_t_plus_deltat = (x_t + k1/6 + k2/3 + k3/3 + k4/6); %numerical solution
